# My own DeFi Dashboard

For starters, I installed NFT to the DeFi Dashboard.

And as tribute to my country, I highlighted one of our popular NFT artist

Featuring [@AswangNFT](https://opensea.io/collection/aswang)

Here's a few of his NFTs on my dashboard...

For the record I built this DeFi Dashboard using...

* Web.3
* Solidity
* React
* React Icons

Credits to Moralis for the backend help

I also used Ropsten Testnet for transfer of assets

There is so much stuff you can do with this like...

* Adding balances of different account address
* ERC20 and ERC21 transfers
* Users can display and sell their own NFTs
* Have it deployed to the mainnet of your choice

Either way, This is a reliable DeFi Dashboard that you can begin with and hone your skills as a Blockchain Developer.
